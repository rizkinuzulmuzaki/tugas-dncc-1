            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About
                29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered
                with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute
                the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided
                into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years.
                Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates
                Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>

            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
                larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often
                referred to as the "<strong>Red Planet</strong>".The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide
                prevalent
                on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies
                visible to the naked eye.Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface
                features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps
                of Earth.</p>

            <h2>Saturn</h2>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It
                is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has
                one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times
                more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its
                astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. The Romans named the seventh day of the week
                Saturday, <i>Sāturni diēs</i> ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn.</p>
